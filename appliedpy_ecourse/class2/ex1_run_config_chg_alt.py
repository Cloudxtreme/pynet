Note, you will need to update the ip_addr, SNMP username and keys to use this script.

You will also need to update the sender and recipient in send_notification.

Note, this alternate version supports Pickle, YAML, and JSON file formats. Change the net_dev_file
variable to .pkl, .yml, or .json to use a different output format.
