Note, you will need to update the ip_addr and COMMUNITY_STRING to use this
script.

Note, making assumption that OID_START_LAST_CHANGED gets reset to 0 on
reload.  This was observed on Cisco881, but do not know how general this
behavior is.

    Three cases:
    1. Normal (no reboot): in sync if start_save_sysuptime >= run_change_sysuptime

    2. Reboot, but subsequent 'wr mem'

       eventhough there has been a reboot, you can revert to normal method.

    3. Reboot, and no subsequent 'wr mem'
       start_save_sysuptime = 0 in this case.  You can't determine whether the
       run and start are in sync (using this method).  Return False in this
       case.
