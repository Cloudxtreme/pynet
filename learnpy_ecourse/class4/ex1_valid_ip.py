discussed in class.  It is not necessarily the best solution to the problem.
In other words, I generally only use things we have covered up to this point

Prompt a user to input an IP address.  Re-using some of the code from class3,
exercise4--determine if the IP address is valid.  Continue prompting the user
to re-input an IP address until a valid IP address is input.
