Create a program that converts the following uptime strings to a time in
seconds.

uptime1 = 'twb-sf-881 uptime is 6 weeks, 4 days, 2 hours, 25 minutes'
uptime2 = '3750RJ uptime is 1 hour, 29 minutes'
uptime3 = 'CATS3560 uptime is 8 weeks, 4 days, 18 hours, 16 minutes'
uptime4 = 'rtr1 uptime is 5 years, 18 weeks, 8 hours, 23 minutes'

For each of these strings store the uptime in a dictionary using the device name
as the key.

During this conversion process, you will have to convert strings to integers.
For these string to integer conversions use try/except to catch any string to
integer conversion exceptions.

For example:
int('5') works fine
int('5 years') generates a ValueError exception.

Print the dictionary to standard output.
