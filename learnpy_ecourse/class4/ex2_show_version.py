discussed in class.  It is not necessarily the best solution to the problem.

Parse the below 'show version' data and obtain the following items (vendor,
model, os_version, uptime, and serial_number).  Try to make your string parsing
generic i.e. it would work for other Cisco IOS devices.

The following are reasonable strings to look for:
'Cisco IOS Software' for vendor and os_version
'bytes of memory' for model
'Processor board ID' for serial_number
' uptime is ' for uptime

Store these variables (vendor, model, os_version, uptime, and serial_number) in
a dictionary.  Print the dictionary to standard output when done.

Note, "Cisco IOS Software...Version 15.0(1)M4...(fc1)" is one line.
