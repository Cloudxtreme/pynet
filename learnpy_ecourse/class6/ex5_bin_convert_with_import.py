5. Write a program that prompts a user for an IP address, then
checks if the IP address is valid, and then converts the IP address
to binary (dotted decimal format).  Re-use the functions created in
exercises 3 and 4 ('import' the functions into your new program).

'''

from ex3_valid_ip import valid_ip
from ex4_binary_converter import convert_ip_to_binary

ip_addr = raw_input("\n\nPlease enter an IP address: ")

if valid_ip(ip_addr):
    print "\n%18s    %-40s\n" % (ip_addr, convert_ip_to_binary(ip_addr))
else:
    print "\nYou entered an invalid IP address!\n"
