discussed in class.  It is not necessarily the best solution to the problem.
In other words, I generally only use things we have covered up to this point

1. Create a function that returns the multiplication product of
three parameters (x, y, z).  z should have a default value of 1.

    a. Call the function with all positional arguments.

    b. Call the function with all named arguments.

    c. Call the function with a mix of positional and named
arguments.

    d. Call the function with only two arguments and use the
default value for z.

    Simple function that returns the product of three numbers

    return x*y*z


# 1a (positional args)
print a_product(3, 4, 5)

# 1b (named args)
print a_product(z=5, y=4, x=3)

# 1c (mix of positional and named)
print a_product(3, z=5, y=4)

# 1d (call with only two args)
print a_product(3, 4)
