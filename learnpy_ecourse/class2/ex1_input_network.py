Disclaimer - This is a solution to the below problem given the content we have
discussed in class.  It is not necessarily the best solution to the problem.
In other words, I only use things we have covered up to this point in the class.

Class#2

I. Create a script that does the following
   A. Prompts the user to input an IP network.

       Notes:
       1. For simplicity the network is always assumed to be a /24 network

       2. The network can be entered in using one of the following three formats
10.88.17.0, 10.88.17., or 10.88.17

   B. Regardless of which of the three formats is used, store this IP network as
a list in the following format ['10', '88', '17', '0'] i.e. a list with four
octets (all strings), the last octet is always zero (a string).

       Hint: There is a way you can accomplish this using a list slice.

       Hint2: If you can't solve this question with a list slice, then try using
the below if statement (note, we haven't discussed if/else conditionals yet; we
will talk about them in the next class).

>>>> CODE <<<<
if len(octets) == 3:
    octets.append('0')
elif len(octets) == 4:
    octets[3] = '0'
>>>> END <<<<

   C. Print the IP network out to the screen.

   D. Print a table that looks like the following (columns 20 characters in
width):

      NETWORK_NUMBER   FIRST_OCTET_BINARY      FIRST_OCTET_HEX
      88.19.107.0      0b1011000               0x58

'''

ip_network = raw_input("\n\nEnter a network number: ")

octets = ip_network.split(".")
octets = octets[:3]
octets.append('0')

network_number = ".".join(octets)
print "\nYour network number is: %s" % network_number

first_octet_bin = bin(int(octets[0]))
first_octet_hex = hex(int(octets[0]))

print "\n\n"
print "%20s %20s %20s" % ("NETWORK_NUMBER", "FIRST_OCTET_BINARY", "FIRST_OCTET_HEX")
print "%20s %20s %20s" % (network_number, first_octet_bin, first_octet_hex)
print "\n\n"
