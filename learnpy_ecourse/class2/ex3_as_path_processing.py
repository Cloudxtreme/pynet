3. You have the following four lines from 'show ip bgp':

entry1 = "*  1.0.192.0/18   157.130.10.233        0 701 38040 9737 i"
entry2 = "*  1.1.1.0/24      157.130.10.233         0 701 1299 15169 i"
entry3 = "*  1.1.42.0/24     157.130.10.233        0 701 9505 17408 2.1465 i"
entry4 = "*  1.0.192.0/19   157.130.10.233        0 701 6762 6762 6762 6762 38040 9737 i"

Note, in each case the AS_PATH starts with '701'.

Using split() and a list slice, how could you process each of these such that--
for each entry, you return an ip_prefix and the AS_PATH (the ip_prefix should be
a string; the AS_PATH should be a list):

Your output should look like this:

ip_prefix           as_path
1.0.192.0/18        ['701', '38040', '9737']
1.1.1.0/24          ['701', '1299', '15169']
1.1.42.0/24         ['701', '9505', '17408', '2.1465']
1.0.192.0/19        ['701', '6762', '6762', '6762', '6762', '38040', '9737']


Ideally, your logic should be the same for each entry (I say this because once I
teach you for loops, then I want to be able to process all of these in one four
loop).

If you can't figure this out using a list slice, you could also solve this using
pop().

print "\n%-20s %-50s" % ("ip_prefix", "as_path")

# really want to use a for loop here :-)
