Disclaimer - This is a solution to the below problem given the content we have
discussed in class.  It is not necessarily the best solution to the problem.
In other words, I only use things we have covered up to this point in the class.
Well, with some minor exceptions I use pprint below.

III. You have the following 'show ip int brief' output.

Interface       IP-Address  OK? Method  Status  Protocol
FastEthernet0   unassigned  YES unset   up      up
FastEthernet1   unassigned  YES unset   up      up
FastEthernet2   unassigned  YES unset   down    down
FastEthernet3   unassigned  YES unset   up      up
FastEthernet4   6.9.4.10    YES NVRAM   up      up
NVI0            6.9.4.10    YES unset   up      up
Tunnel1         16.25.253.2 YES NVRAM   up      down
Tunnel2         16.25.253.6 YES NVRAM   up      down
Vlan1           unassigned  YES NVRAM   down    down
Vlan10          10.220.88.1 YES NVRAM   up      up
Vlan20          192.168.0.1 YES NVRAM   down    down
Vlan100         10.220.84.1 YES NVRAM   up      up

From this output, create a list where each element in the list is a tuple
consisting of (interface_name, ip_address, status, protocol).  Only include
interfaces that are in the up/up state.

Print this list to standard output.
