Disclaimer - This is a solution to the below problem given the content we have
discussed in class.  It is not necessarily the best solution to the problem.
In other words, I only use things we have covered up to this point in the class
(with some minor exceptions).

Learning Python
Class#3

I. Create an IP address converter (dotted decimal to binary).  This will be
similar to what we did in class2 except:

    A. Make the IP address a command-line argument instead of prompting the user
for it.
            ./binary_converter.py 10.88.17.23

    B. Simplify the script logic by using the flow-control statements that we
learned in this class.

    C. Zero-pad the digits such that the binary output is always 8-binary digits
long.  Strip off the leading '0b' characters.  For example,

        OLD:     0b1010
        NEW:    00001010

    D. Print to standard output using a dotted binary format.  For example,

        IP address          Binary
        10.88.17.23        00001010.01011000.00010001.00010111

    Note, you will probably need to use a 'while' loop and a 'break' statement
for part C.

        while True:
            ...
            break       # on some condition (exit the while loop)

    Python will execute this loop again and again until the 'break' is encountered.
