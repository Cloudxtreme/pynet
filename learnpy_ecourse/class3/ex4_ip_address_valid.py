Disclaimer - This is a solution to the below problem given the content we have
discussed in class.  It is not necessarily the best solution to the problem.
In other words, I only use things we have covered up to this point in the class.
Well, with some exceptions (I use try / except below).

V. Create a script that checks the validity of an IP address.  The IP address
should be supplied on the command line.
    A. Check that the IP address contains 4 octets.
    B. The first octet must be between 1 - 223.
    C. The first octet cannot be 127.
    D. The IP address cannot be in the 169.254.X.X address space.
    E. The last three octets must range between 0 - 255.

    For output, print the IP and whether it is valid or not.
